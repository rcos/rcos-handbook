## Guidelines

### Be respectful and inclusive

- **Use inclusive language.** This includes:
  - Using [gender-neutral or non-gendered language](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language) where possible
  - When referring to community members, using their [correct pronouns](https://www.brynmawr.edu/sites/default/files/asking-for-name-and-pronouns.pdf)
  - In general, avoiding any language that could be considered offensive towards marginalized groups
- **Respect people's differences.** Examples include:
  - Being welcoming towards new members
  - Being open to opposing viewpoints
  - Being understanding of cultural differences
  - Making sure your project and any physical spaces your project team may meet are accessible to all members, including members with disabilities

### Give and be welcoming to constructive feedback

- **Be constructive and respectful** when giving others feedback. This includes:
  - Keeping all feedback constructive, objective and impersonal
- **Be accepting of constructive criticism**. If you feel that any critiques are overly harsh, excessive, or harassing, contact a Coordinator ASAP.

### Focus on what is best for the RCOS community

- **Show empathy towards other community members.** Examples include:
  - Actively listening to other team members
  - "Stepping back" and allowing others to participate when you feel that you are dominating a conversation
  - Respecting other people's boundaries and privacy
- **Acknowledge and learn from mistakes**. This includes:
  - Working to eliminate unconscious bias
  - Being aware of how your actions affect others
  - Correcting any harmful behavior going forward

## Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behaviors include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment as defined [here](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/community/harassment_guidelines)
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Reporting Incidents

At any point, you may report instances of CoC violations to our [Coordinators](https://rcos.github.io/rcos-handbook/#/leadership/coordinators) and [Faculty Advisors](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/leadership/faculty) at <rcos-leadership@googlegroups.com>. You, as well as any other witnesses, have the right to remain anonymous to the rest of the RCOS community.

If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Coordinators for any reason, you may reach out to a Faculty Advisor directly via our [Discord server](https://rcos.io/register).

## Project Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. In the case of contributors external to RPI and/or RCOS, temporary or permanent bans may occur. RPI-specific policies are outlined below.

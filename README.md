# RCOS Handbook
Organization documentation for RCOS

<!-- This repository exists to introduce each new semester of RCOS. The presentation folder contains a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation that is shown on the first day of class. This README contains all the information in the presentation in a bit more detail. -->

This is intended to be a thorough, living document detailing the organizational practices of RCOS at every level. If you find a problem or something that you'd like to dispute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rcos/handbook/issues/new).

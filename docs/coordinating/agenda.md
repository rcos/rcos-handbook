# First Two Weeks Agenda

The first two weeks is an extremely important time to get new students acquainted with RCOS, old students updated on any changes in structure/leadership, assigning mentors and a handful of other tasks. This is the most important time for the coordinators to be "on top of things".

## Before the First Meeting
Prior to the first meeting, mentors and new coordinators should be chosen. Any planned changes should be reflected in the relevant documentation and/or presentations. The coordinators should meet to plan and make sure all administrative affairs are in order.

## Outline
All of the following details need to be worked out within the first two weeks
* RCOS Concepts
  - History Reviewed
  - Structure, Grading and Motivations introduced
  - Sponsors introduced
  - Small groups introduced
  - Semester Goals introduced
  - Presentation rules and guidelines
* Old Projects Pitched
* New Projects Pitched
* Project Matching
* URP/4UR (School Paperwork) Filled Out

## First Meeting

The first meeting is to be held on the first Tuesday or Friday of classes, whichever comes first.

The first meeting begins with the [rcos introduction slides](https://rcos.github.io/intro), presented by the student coordinators. The slides go through the stucture of RCOS and how to participate. A faculty coordinator will then give a talk on the history of RCOS, and briefly explain some administrative details.

After the intro talk, mentors are announced and given the chance to introduce themselves. Mentors should say a few sentences about themselves and what experience they have.

It is stated that a select few projects will pitch at the second meeting, and all other projects will pitch on the third meeting (giving time for people who are new to RCOS to join the project). Pitch slides are collected by a coordinator until 11:59PM the night before the third meeting.

Existing projects are reminded to submit proposals. Existing projects are asked to fill out a form expressing their small group mentor/technology preference.

## Second Meeting

At the second meeting, the expectations of working on a project for credit are defined. The rubric is explained with emphasis on changes / improvements from the previous year based on feedback from students and mentors. Coordinators should be careful not to sound stringent or cold, while making clear that working on a project for credit does require a commitment and the students' best effort.

After expectations are defined, students are reminded how to pitch their projects the following meeting, and a select few projects will then give their pitches. These are typically the most well-established projects, projects that need more time to pitch, or sponsored / external projects. If needed, some such projects may pitch at the third meeting as well.

## Third Meeting

The third meeting is dedicated solely to project pitches. Each pitch should be no more than one minute long, although exceptions are sometimes made for 'special' projects.

Additional information should be kept to the minimum. Students should be encouraged to get in touch with project leaders and mentors for help picking a project, and should be reminded of the URP form deadlines.

## Fourth Meeting

The fourth meeting has two parts that occur simultaneously: project 'Speed Dating' and proposal approval. The mentors should be split evenly between the two events, with each occuring in its own room. Finding a project can be very nervewracking for newcomers, so project speed dating is intended to ensure every student finds a project.

In one room, every project that is looking for more group members should have a representative present to talk to potential group members. The representative should have a printed copy of their pitch slide to identify themself. Every student that does not yet have a project will be present, and will be able to talk to the project representatives and find a project that matches their interest. Mentors should be present to guide students who appear lost or anxious, and to make sure each project gets members. Once students have selected their project, or if they already have a project, they should go to the second room.

In the second room, mentors should be present to look over student's proposals and approve them. If a proposal does not meet the guidelines, mentors should assist the project members in modifying their proposal.

Every for-credit student must have a project with an approved proposal by the end of the fourth meeting.

## Prior to the Fifth Meeting

Mentor groups should selected and rooms should be assigned prior to the fifth meeting. Each mentor group should have its own room. Projects should be distributed amongst mentor groups as evenly as possible. Projects should be assigned to mentors with relevant skill sets so the mentors can best provide technical assistance when needed. All students should be informed of their mentor groups prior to the fifth meeting. If the fifth meeting is a Tuesday, students should report directly to their mentor group.

At least one mentor meeting must occur prior to the fifth meeting. Mentors should be instructured to ensure that mentees:
1. Are on [rcos.io](https://rcos.io).
2. Are on [rcos.slack.com](https://rcos.slack.com)

Additionally, general mentoring strategies and tips should be discussed. Any larger goals for the year should be made clear and a schedule for mentor meetings should be set.

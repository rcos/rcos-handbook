# Mentors

## Mentors

Mentors are the life blood of RCOS, a mentor can help you with technical problems, show
you where/how to find help for your project, and help you find a new project etc.

### Mentor Responsibilities
- Help point students to what they need to do/where they need to go within RCOS
- Make sure your mentees are on their schedule OR have documented reasons to be off their schedule.
- Set up whatever organization/goal structure you feel is best for helping students be successful with their open source contributions; this is what gives a small group personality.
- In general, help maintain the freedom and culture of RCOS and encourage open source contribution.

### How to be a good mentor
- Help mentees to reach their own goals
- Talk directly to projects and mentees, understand what their project is and where you can help
- Share ideas and contribute to development of RCOS as a whole- as long as you're monitoring the #mentors slack channel you should opportunities to contribute.

### Things Mentors should Know
- Names and channels for referring mentees to coordinators or faculty
- How to direct mentees to the [rcos intro slides](http://rcos.github.io/intro/#/)

## Student Coordinators

Student coordinators are mentors that organize the first couple weeks as well
as the large group meetings. If you're having an issue and your mentor can't
point you in the right direction, a coordinator will be able to direct you
towards another mentor, faculty or help you directly.

## External Mentors

External mentors are mentors that help projects remotely. External mentors serve a different role than regular student mentors.

In particular, they get the following exceptions:
- External mentors don't need to attend small and large group meetings
- External mentors don't need to understand the logistics of RCOS (students should ask their student mentors for this)

External mentors have their own sets of requirements, usually they provide a subset of the following responsibilities...
- Get students involved with industry or personal projects outside of RCOS
- Assist students with problems with a technology stack
- Introduce students to new technologies
- Provide advice to students regarding open source technologies

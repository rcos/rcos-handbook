# Documentation Guidelines

Project repos must have a README and LICENSE, and each semester a project must submit a proposal that must be reviewed and approved. Other forms of documentation are encouraged and detailed below.

## Required Documentation

### README

Every project repository is **required** to have a `README` file in the root directory with a description of the project, instructions for contributing, and any other information needed to develop for and use the project. The last two can also be moved to their own files, but must be publicly present in the repository. Remember that not everyone looking at your project repository will already be familiar with your project!

?> If you just started your project, you may not have setup instructions yet. Be sure to update your README as your project progresses!

### LICENSE

From the Open Source Initiative:

> Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition — in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative (also known as the OSI), a license must go through the Open Source Initiative's license review process.

Every project repository is **required** to have a `LICENSE` file in the root directory with an OSI-approved [open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/category). If you are unsure what to choose, check out the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) for an excellent guide on finding the right license for your project. This is often done automatically when creating a repository on a platform such as GitHub.

### Proposal

Every semester, **every** project must develop and submit a proposal document detailing the following:

- Project title
- Project Lead(s)
- Project contributors
- Project description
- Milestones for the semester on a **monthly** basis

?> Check out this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CS5jjniYmfA-n8yBO89hdcNFde4eTQiyte8diMIU-J8/edit) you can follow or this [past proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdEsEn1cOOYGZMzunM63HC699bbJs-LZ1lYEGVoCBoo/edit?usp=sharing).

Your project proposal gives us an idea of what your project is about, how many people you are working with, and what goals you have for the semester. We understand that your ideas and goals can change as the semester progresses, and that is fine! While your team's contributions to your project should be related to your milestones, we do not grade contributions based on how successful you were at reaching them. We encourage you to continually update each semester's proposal as well.

## Suggested Documentation

### Code of Conduct

Our Community Code of Conduct outlines what we expect from members of the RCOS community. As your project grows, a community will hopefully grow with it. Your project is never too small to have a Code of Conduct in place to outline community guidelines and foster a welcoming community. You may use any Code of Conduct you wish, as long as it is compatible with our Community Code of Conduct.

We at RCOS have created a [Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/blob/master/docs/community/code_of_conduct_template.md) for your project based on our Code of Conduct. If you wish to use it, create a file in your repository's root folder called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and copy and paste the text, changing `[Your Project]` to your project's name.

Another popular option is the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct, which can be dropped into your project very easily (and in fact, part of our Code of Conduct was modified from the Contributor Covenant).

If you would like to use another Code of Conduct, most existing Code of Conduct templates are compatible with our Community Code of Conduct. The only Code of Conduct templates which are **not** compatible with the RCOS Community Code of Conduct are those based on a "No Code of Conduct" policy.

### Contributing Guidelines

Your contributing guidelines should outline how to contribute to your project via issues or pull requests.

Here is a [contributing template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md) to get you started.

Once you have your contributing guidelines in place, a link to these guidelines will appear whenever someone opens an issue or pull request.

<!-- TODO: create a template specifically for RCOS projects -->

### Issue or Pull Request Template

GitHub allows you to create issue or pull request templates. [Here is information on how to create a template](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/).

#### Issue Template

If you choose to create an issue template, you are advised to create at least two templates: a bug template and a feature template.

#### Pull Request Template

GitHub will automatically create a pull request template for you. If you would like to add more to the template, feel free to do so.

### Additional Documentation

Additional documentation is strongly encouraged! There is no specific format you must follow for additional documentation, but here are a few ideas:

- Project blog
- API docs
- Wiki
- Static website
- Style guide

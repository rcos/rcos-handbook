# Presentation Guidelines

Each group will be required to poster at the RCOS Expo which typically falls on the third to last, and second to last day of classes each semester. Posters and presentations should be well prepared and rehearsed. Final Presentations factor into your RCOS grade. See the categories below for what is required and the approximate grading weight of each category. (Outstanding performace in one category may increase your grade but poor performance will not hurt your grade for that category more than the weights below)

We know that presentations can be stressful. RCOS presentations are meant to be fun and informational. Don't worry too much about them. Follow the guidelines below and you'll do well!

### Effectiveness of Presentation (30%)

Ensure your poster and presentaion are well-rehearsed and concise. You should give your audience an organized idea of what happened (good/bad/unexpected) in the semester. Your poster should be created in a way that is easy to follow for the viewer as you explain it. Make sure you are not simply reading off of the poster and instead enganging with your audience

### Title (10%)

Include your full project title in your presentation!

### Teammates (10%)

Ensure every team member taking RCOS for credit is involved in the presentation. 

### Description (20%)

Describe your project to an audience that has no prior familiarity with it. Explain the purpose of the project and the specific technologies used. Feel free to touch on why you chose the particular stack. What does your project do? Who are your potential clients? Why is this project important? 

### Organization (20%)

Where is your project hosted? Do you use GitHub Issues, Project Boards, Wiki, etc. for project management? How are you set up with respect to building community? Do you have guidelines for new contributors? Getting started documentation? Do you need it? Screenshots are good for this section. How does your poster look? Is it easy to understand what your project was from the poster alone? Did you include images of your project?

### Progress (10%)

Show proof of the progress you made **over this semester.** What goals did you reach? Which did you not reach? Be honest! 

## Previous Presentation Examples

Previous poster examples will be made available through the slides in class close to the RCOS Expo. If you would like poster examples outside of this please reach out to the Coordinator or Faculty Advisor.

# Grading Rubric

Although RCOS is a team sport, grading is done on each individual member. 
Make sure you meet the requirements, including the requirements on the project itself such as the README, License and other forms of documentation. The rubric is written in terms of A, B, C, D, and F. Plus (+) and minus (-) 
modifiers may be used for performance near the boundary of two levels.

**We have tried to make this rubric broadly applicable to the wide variety of projects we find in RCOS. 
Certainly, each category of Open Source Contributions, Status Updates, Presentations, Community Involvement, and Attendance are critical to success in RCOS and often to the Open Source processes as well. 
Remember that we can only evaluate your contributions to the extent that you allow us to see what you are doing. 
If you have issues with any rubric item, or if you cannot figure out how to make your particular RCOS project openly visible, please talk to a coordinator or faculty member so that we can help you be as Open as possible.**

## 50% - Open Source Contributions
RCOS is, at heart, about participation in the Open Source Ecosystem. 
As part of this semester long journey, you need to make contributions to the community. 
They need to be significant, licensed correctly to allow open reuse, and importantly, they need to be findable. 
This applies to code contributions, design documents, hardware diagrams, description of issues found and overcome, and to all the other artifacts that would allow someone else to retrace your footsteps and replicate your accomplishments.

**We understand that during their first semester of participation or during 
the first semester of a new project, students do not always have a lot of 
code to commit. Do not let that keep you from making open source contrbutions. 
The investigations, research and design you are exploring should be used to 
create tutorials, design documents, user studies, etc., 
all of which can
be included in your repository in appropriate directories and should also be reflected 
in well structured status updates. If you 
are having problems deciding how to contribute, please see your mentor, a
coordinator or a faculty advisor for help and suggestions. Failure to do so will impact your grade.**

| Grade | Description |
|-|-|
| **A** | Makes meaningful contributions to several milestones. Student is active on GitHub and Mattermost and makes excellent use of issue tracking and project management systems. Student communicates failures and development barriers to their team and mentors and documents them for the future, and makes their best effort to overcome challenges. Open contributions are licensed correctly with an OSI approved license, are easy to find and can be easily obtained and used.|
| **B** | Makes meaningful contributions to several milestones, but may be slightly lacking in communication and/or planning requirements, or may not make good use of issue tracking / project management systems. Open contributions are licensed correctly and can be easily obtained and used, but may not be easy to find.|
| **C** | Makes too few contributions and does not ask for help when needed. Student makes little to no use of issue tracking and project management systems, and does not communicate well with team members or mentors. Open contributions may not be licensed correctly, may not be easily obtained and used, or may not be easy to find.|
| **D** | Makes almost no meaningful contributions and makes little effort to communicate with team members and mentors, or contributions are not licensed correctly.|
| **F** | Makes no visible effort to contribute to their project or communicate with their team and mentors. |

## 25% - Status Updates and Project Documentation
Your community needs to know what you are working on and what you have accomplished, and we need to know that you are engaged throughout the semester.
Keeping us informed with a weekly status blog and by keeping your project documentation up to date will help us and will allow us to give you the grade you deserve.

| Grade | Description |
|-|-|
| **A** | Makes frequent (weekly), high caliber status updates documenting each issue they work on and several problems they solve or investigate deeply. Project has a helpful README, and has additional documentation that is of quality and value. The Final Status update is a concise but complete summary of the year's efforts and accomplishments.|
| **B** | Makes status updates that may be too few or brief OR project may not have may not have much additional documentation. Final status update is missing or does not fully capture the project status.|
| **C** | Makes only a few or low quality status updates, OR project may have little other documentation. |
| **D** | Makes few status updates of little to no value and does not contribute to other forms of documentation. |
| **F** | Makes no status updates and contributes no effort toward documenting the project. Project does not have a meaningful README or license. |

## 15% - Presentations and Outreach
External outreach is especially critical on projects with no formal management structure. 
You need to develop the ability to represent yourself, your project and RCOS. 
Presentations and outreach are critical to this learning goal.

| Grade | Description |
|-|-|
| **A** | Participates in large group presentation and demonstrates a knowledge of what they worked on; is well prepared and clearly rehearsed. Represents RCOS externally by either hosting at least one well prepared and useful tech talk or bonus session OR attending at least one bonus session beyond any used to make up missing attendance. |
| **B** | Makes a reasonable effort to participate in presentation and is at least somewhat prepared. Hosts a tech talk or bonus session OR attends the requisite bonus session. |
| **C** | Is unprepared for presentation or does not participate heavily. Hosts a tech talk or bonus session OR attends the requisite bonus session. |
| **D** | Makes little effort to participate in presentation and does not host tech talk, bonus session, or attend bonus sessions. |
| **F** | Makes no effort to participate in presentation or does not attend. Does not host tech talk, bonus session, or attend any bonus sessions. |

## 10% - Attendance
You cannot learn, participate, or share unless you are here. 
Attendance at RCOS is required. 
You may miss up to two small group meetings without an excuse and can make up an additional two meetings by attending more than the required number of bonus sessions. 
Unexcused absences beyond those allowed will impact your grade.
We understand that there are occasional conflicts that require you to be absent from an RCOS meeting without a formal excuse.
Please see a coordinator or faculty member prior to any conflicts to make arrangements.
See our [documentation on attendance](attendance.md) for further details on what constitutes a bonus session as well as our official excused absence policy.

| Grade | Description |
|-|-|
| **A** | Goes to all required meetings. Attends at least one additional bonus session beyond that necessary for making up absences. |
| **B** | Misses no more than three meetings and makes up most unexcused absences. |
| **C** | Repeatedly misses meetings or does not make up unexcused absences. |
| **D** | Misses many meetings and does not attempt to make up unexcused absences. |
| **F** | Makes no effort to regularly attend meetings. |

## Citizenship
We want all of you at RCOS to learn in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. 
Part of fostering this environment includes practicing good citizenship.
The way you conduct yourself at RCOS may have a long-lasting impact on the community, whether that be positive or negative.

Students who go above and beyond to model and encourage positive behaviors outlined in our community Code of Conduct may receive:
- additional consideration for leadership positions within RCOS (e.g. task force teams, mentor, coordinator)
- recognition from the community as a model citizen

On the other hand, students may be penalized, depending on the severity of the offense, for violating the Code of Conduct. 
These penalties are given at faculty discretion and may range from a small attendance penalty to an F in the course. 
Please review the [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well as our [Bylaws](community/bylaws.md) for more detailed information.

# Grading Rubric for Mentors

Mentors have a unique responsibility within RCOS. As a mentor you are
expected to run a small group, be familiar with all the projects in your
group, fill out evaluations, provide guidance and technical support to
projects in your group, and to regularly attend mentor meetings. Additionally, you 
are expected to help us plan and execute external events such as code jams, 
bonus sessions, and our weekly coding open houses. Because of this added 
responsiblity, you are given more leeway on the open source contributions as 
well as other rubric items above.

At a minimum a mentor is expected to host at least one workshop.

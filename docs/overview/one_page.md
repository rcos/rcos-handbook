# One Page Unofficial Syllabus

This is the unofficial "syllabus" for the RCOS Spring 2024 Semester. This was made so students have easy and quick access to the most important information about RCOS like: what rcos is, faculty advisor names and contact information, student grade rubric, Mentor grade rubric, a brief semester outline, learning outcomes, and finally academic policies.

## What is RCOS?

The **Rensselaer Center for Open Source** - or **RCOS** (*`ar-kos`*) for short - is a community of motivated students at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu) who develop open source projects under the guidance of experienced instructors and student mentors.

## Our Mission Statement

> To cultivate an inclusive, creative, and entrepreneurial community that seeks to empower students to develop open-source solutions to real-world problems.

## What do we do?

RCOS members collaborate on open-source projects throughout the semester. Members may participate as students pursuing free elective course credit or recreationally for experience. At the beginning of each semester, members may propose an outline for a new or existing project or join a project proposed by another member. Members enrolled for credit must regularly be in attendance, produce regular progress updates, and give a final presentation.

All members are encouraged to produce successful projects. Still, the primary goals are to be exposed to interesting ideas, technologies, and people while gaining practical experience outside the classroom in a low-risk environment.

### 25% - Status Updates and Project Documentation

Your community needs to know what you are working on and what you have accomplished, and we need to know that you are engaged throughout the semester.
Keeping us informed with a weekly status update and by keeping your project documentation up to date will help us and will allow us to give you the grade you deserve.

## Grading Rubric for Mentors

Mentors have a unique responsibility within RCOS. As a mentor you are
expected to run a Small Group, be familiar with all the projects in your
group, fill out evaluations, provide guidance and technical support to
projects in your group, and to regularly attend mentor meetings. Because of this added responsiblity, you are given more leeway on the number of open source contributions as well as other rubric items below.

At a minimum a mentor is **required** to host at least one workshop.

### 50% - Open Source Contributions & RCOS Community Service

RCOS is, at heart, about participation in the Open Source Ecosystem. *Mentorship includes contributing to the RCOS community.*

| **A** | Makes significant contributions to open-source projects **and the RCOS organization**. This can include effective management of small-group rooms, marking student contributions, answering student questions, promoting RCOS externally, and generally allowing the RCOS organization to function as a strong component of the RPI campus.

Student communicates failures and development barriers to their team and documents them for the future, and makes their best effort to overcome challenges.

| **B** | Makes multiple meaningful contributions to projects **and the RCOS organization**, but may be slightly lacking in communication and/or planning requirements, or may not make good use of issue tracking / project management systems.

### 25% - Status Updates and Project Documentation

Mentors help bridge communication between RCOS students and coordinators. Mentor-specific status updates serve as a way to keep coordinators aware of the general status of each room, projects that may be running into issues or facing blockers, as well as students notable for going above and beyond. 

These status updates specifically require, in addition to everything required in student status updates, updates on each project within the room and students that may require more help or attention.

## Academic Policies

### Academic Integrity

Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and The Graduate Student Supplement define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. 

Violations of academic integrity may also be reported to the appropriate Dean (Dean of Students for undergraduate students or the Dean of Graduate Education for graduate students, respectively).

If you have any question concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification. In addition, you can visit the following site for more information on our Academic Integrity Policy: [Students Rights, Responsibilities, and Judicial Affairs](https://info.rpi.edu/dean-students/student-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct).

To establish reasonable accommodations, please register with The Office of Disability Services for Students.  After registration, make arrangements with the Director of Disability Services as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion.

### Additional Academic Integrity Course Policy and Penalty Information

Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process.

In this course, collaboration is expected and encouraged, as is the appropriate use of open source resources and code. All such uses should abide by the appropriate licensing and attribution requirements. Students should not represent other people's code as their own.

The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Graduate Student Supplement (For 6000 level and above courses) define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. All assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in (1) an academic (grade) penalty and (2) reporting to the Dean of Academic Affairs and either the Dean of Students (for Undergraduates) or the Dean of Graduate Education (for Graduate students).

In this course, the academic penalty for a first offense is loss of a letter grade. A second offense will result in failure of the course. If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.
